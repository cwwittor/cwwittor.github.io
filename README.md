Homework 2 for my bootcamp class

Am very late with this due to falling behind in class due to personal family problems and was trying to focus on current homework the following weeks after this assignment.

Have spent a lot of time putting thought and working on this project and I am still needing to both get resources taken for it as well as I want to put more time into it. This is the barebones starter of my website and my plans to go forward with it.

From the different pages there are 4 total html files which are the 4 pages in the webportfolio. For the first page we have the stanard front page that I want to keep pretty bare with a nice picture in the background of myself at the beach near me. The second page is my "About Me" page where I have a grid system setup where I will be writing and updating the various skills/assets that I will bring to my future employer as well as I will include a professional picture of myself. The third html is my portfolio where I link my repos and deployed applications with animated gifs to show what each does. The final repo is a contact form that I have setup.

There was a lot I've learned about front end design through this assignment and there is a lot I plan to change about it. One notable place that I will start is getting my footer to look nicer as well as placing it on my aboutme page when the layout is better positioned. Another change will come to the responsiveness of the portfolio which does work fine in mobile and desktop but the scaling inbetween looks messy.
